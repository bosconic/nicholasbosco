## Bio

As a kid, I have always been interested in a good story. My desire to share ideas and experiences with others is my biggest strength. I have tried many fields of study throughout my academic journey but trying to stick within the social science/humanities stream. Currently in my 3rd year at the University Of Toronto studying Information Studies. I feel this program encapsulates what I value most: the importance of narrative and what it means to share information. As I navigate the world, I find my curiosity leads me to extraordinary discoveries. I am very passionate about learning and reading for pleasure. I spend most of my time connecting with people and having a meaningful dialogue. In the future, I hope to become a museum curator because I feel the role of the curator is like a mediator between sharing the stories of objects and their function.
