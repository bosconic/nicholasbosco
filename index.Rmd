## Bio
As a kid, I have always been interested in a good story. My desire to share ideas and experiences with others is my biggest strength. I have tried many fields of study throughout my academic journey but trying to stick within the social science/humanities stream. Currently in my 3rd year at the University Of Toronto studying Information Studies. I feel this program encapsulates what I value most: the importance of narrative and what it means to share information. As I navigate the world, I find my curiosity leads me to extraordinary discoveries. I am very passionate about learning and reading for pleasure; I have created an Instagram book talk account called: *Lost In a Tangent Book Club*. The account is where I read books and share their summary and analysis of a message I was able to draw from the book and connect it to my experiences. I spend most of my time connecting with people and having a meaningful dialogue. In the future, I hope to become a museum curator because I feel the role of the curator is like a mediator between sharing the stories of objects and their function.
