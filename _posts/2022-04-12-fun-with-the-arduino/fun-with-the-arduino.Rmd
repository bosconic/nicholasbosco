The DI Design group consisted of Marco Chau, Chyna Hui, Zoie Soying, Yahui Zhang, and Elizabeth Yao Tong  We had the prompt of building a collaborative computer in the class *INF351: How to Build a Computer and Why?*. A collaborative computer is defined as a computer that involves more than one user at a time. We noticed that sometimes kids are just told what they should know, and on tests, they have to recite what they remember. However, this way of learning is inefficient in the classroom because this does not prepare the child for the real world, by just memorizing facts will not prepare the student for what is to come. The DI design group had created a computer (the image above) using an Arduino and the LCD to remedy this. We can now make learning more engaging and impact for the student. So they can learn from their peers and other stimuli like the display to get feedback and improve their learning. This introduction of a computerized flash-card quiz game tries to incorporate the computer into education and point to a new way learning can be incorporated into a classroom with the help of a computer. This prompt taught me how computers could have multiple applications and be used as an object of enjoyment instead of completing a specific task.
