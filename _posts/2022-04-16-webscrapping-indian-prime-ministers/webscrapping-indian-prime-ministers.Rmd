There are many ways to collect data, from the people we interact with to the websites we create. What is quite interesting about the data out in the world is that it is in front of our faces, but we choose what we would like to investigate or, in my case, to learn more about. Then taking said data and giving it some context transform data into information, but this information you see or hear can be altered into knowledge. Knowledge is what we as people within society try to use the information gathered. After learning about this new way of gathering data, turning said data into information, and then presenting my information as knowledge on a particular subject, I decided to look at the list of Indian Prime Ministers from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_India). The purpose of this journey was to learn how to web scrape, following the example from my professor: Rohan Alexander's book [*Telling Stories with Data*](https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/gather-data.html#web-scraping). I can say I have lots to learn, but happy with the result of the work produced. To see the final results check out: [Standing On the Shoulders Of Prime Ministers](https://github.com/bosconic/bosconic)
