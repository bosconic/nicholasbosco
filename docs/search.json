To solidify the themes/concepts learned in\nclass, I was fortunate enough to be in a well-rounded group of\nindividuals that, like me, did not have much experience in design,\ncreate an app that is beneficial to not only the students of the\nUniversity of Toronto but University students at large.\nIdeation\n\n\n\nPersona was generated through primary\nand secondary research and interviews\nThe Blue Fanatics (our group name) consisted of Zoie S.,\nBenner F., Tiago M. and Yahui Z. Together, we presented our idea for an\napp called “The Blueprint”. The vision of our app was to centralize\nevents that happen on campus and provide the students with the\ninformation they need so that they can be a part of the University of\nToronto Community that is not strictly an academic setting. This was a\nvery apparent issue when we interviewed people trying to understand how\ncurrent students get involved. We found it was tough for students to\nbecome aware of events they would gladly partake in. So our goal\nwas to take the bits of fragmented information scattered around campus\nand generate a centralized information app that enables our persona: Sam\nthe Student to be more engaged with extra curricular activities at\nschool.\n\n\n\nThe possible ways to produce The\nBlueprint\nWhen coming up with the ideal solution to produce a platform for a\ncentralized event app. The kinds of ideas here we had decided to\ncategorize in three distinct categories but using a prioritization grid\nwhere we evaluate ideas as a group between feasibility and impact there\nwas a unanimous decision on generating “The Blueprint” as a mobile phone\napplicaton.\nCreation/Testing\nThanks to the usability testing and constant iterations, The Blue\nFanatics, the name we called our group have fleshed out an\napplication that is tangible with our low-fidelity and medium-fidelity\nprototypes that actually propose the incorporation of “The Blueprint” in\nsociety at large and its immediate rewards. To see the storyboards and\nprototypes used for testing click\nhere.\nNext Steps\n\nIf our group were to continue the development of our app, there are a\ncouple of things we would like to see added. Fleshing out the amount of\ninformation displayed on the device’s screen would likely be one thing\nwe do. If our marketing of the app is based around how it has all the\ninformation a student needs, our prototype should reflect that, instead\nof just having placeholders for where information would go. Another\nfeature we would put in is more distinct filters. Being able to switch\nbetween academic events, school-affiliated extracurricular, and sporting\nevents, for instance, would allow the user to clearly find what they are\nlooking for.\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nReflection\nBeing from a humanities background, with minimal coding and\nstatistical experience, I was a bit frightened by the almighty “R”. However, when learning what R\nwas and how it is used by many to illustrate narratives through\nstatistics, I was immediately hooked to the stories that can be used to\ntalk about what I interact with through numbers. With the helpful\npatience, wisdom and guidance of my professor: Rohan\nAlexander, I was able to warm up to the idea of coding, more\nspecifically R, and I am forever grateful. Rohan’s class was called\nINF312: Telling Stories With Data. Being an avid reader with a\npassion for stories, I had decided to leave behind my fears and worries\nwith coding and get my elbows dirty by wrangling R and using R as my\nmedium to generate stories about the world through data. But this course\nalso taught me valuable lessons and gave me some interesting insights\ninto what is in store for my future, as I now have a new skill in my\nso-called toolkit to unpack and apply to the world around me in my\nfuture endeavours. From being a bit afraid of R to now creating my\ndigital portfolio using R, precisely the distill packages show the\nkind of growth I had as a student. But it is not just R I got to play\naround with. I also learned about Github and how amazing it is as a\nresource and repository for work.\nWriting Samples with R\nOver the winter semester, I had found a silver lining between\nnarratives of my work produced with my introduction to R. This\nconnection was entirely by chance. Still, it speaks volumes about what I\nam most curious about, Family Dynamics.\nThe progression first report started out with Marriage. I tried to\nget a glimpse of the number of Marriage Licenses given out in Toronto at\na particular month, trying to see if there could be a conclusion to be\nmade; the short answer is yes, but to really see, check out the Tieing The Knot\nIn TO.\n\n\n\n\nMoving onto the second report, I was able to work with Benner F. and\nElizabeth Y.T. The three of us looked at the Canadian GSS Family Cycle\n31 Of 2017. Through the numerous categories and the sheer about of data\nprovided by CHASS (Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences),\nData Center has partnered with many institutions to allow students from\nmany disciplines to access data and interpret our world through data.\nThe basis for the report was trying to capture any trends within the\nCanadian Family and try to write a narrative on our findings through the\ndata gathered. To see our total findings and narrative, check out Capturing\nthe Happy Family\n\n\n\n\nThe final report for the class I am currently writing is about\nPolygamy in Senegal during the 1980s. The idea for this report was to\nlink the story,So Long a Letter by Mariama Ba about the main\ncharacter’s attitudes towards polygamy with the data from the\nSenegal DHS 1986 give some context to why the author of the\nbook was writing about polygamy the way she does.\n\nFuture Hopes\nWith my newfound appreciation for R, I am confident my curiosity and\nsheer enthusiasm for stories will be forever impacted. Now I can use\ndata to touch on topics I was initially scared to look into, like\nstatistics, math and finance. But I also see there is a whole new side\nof using R with the ideas I am a bit more familiar with and see if I can\nuse the data collected and gathered as a way to speak to a broader\naudience or to a reader who has different interests and background\nknowledge than me but still gather the messages I try to put out with my\nfuture works. Either way, I think this class really changed how I view\ninformation, data, and knowledge.\n\n\n\n",
