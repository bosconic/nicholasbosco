To solidify the themes/concepts learned in\r\nclass, I was fortunate enough to be in a well-rounded group of\r\nindividuals that, like me, did not have much experience in design,\r\ncreate an app that is beneficial to not only the students of the\r\nUniversity of Toronto but University students at large.\r\nIdeation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersona was generated through primary\r\nand secondary research and interviews\r\nThe Blue Fanatics (our group name) consisted of Zoie S.,\r\nBenner F., Tiago M. and Yahui Z. Together, we presented our idea for an\r\napp called “The Blueprint”. The vision of our app was to centralize\r\nevents that happen on campus and provide the students with the\r\ninformation they need so that they can be a part of the University of\r\nToronto Community that is not strictly an academic setting. This was a\r\nvery apparent issue when we interviewed people trying to understand how\r\ncurrent students get involved. We found it was tough for students to\r\nbecome aware of events they would gladly partake in. So our goal\r\nwas to take the bits of fragmented information scattered around campus\r\nand generate a centralized information app that enables our persona: Sam\r\nthe Student to be more engaged with extra curricular activities at\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possible ways to produce The\r\nBlueprint\r\nWhen coming up with the ideal solution to produce a platform for a\r\ncentralized event app. The kinds of ideas here we had decided to\r\ncategorize in three distinct categories but using a prioritization grid\r\nwhere we evaluate ideas as a group between feasibility and impact there\r\nwas a unanimous decision on generating “The Blueprint” as a mobile phone\r\napplicaton.\r\nCreation/Testing\r\nThanks to the usability testing and constant iterations, The Blue\r\nFanatics, the name we called our group have fleshed out an\r\napplication that is tangible with our low-fidelity and medium-fidelity\r\nprototypes that actually propose the incorporation of “The Blueprint” in\r\nsociety at large and its immediate rewards. To see the storyboards and\r\nprototypes used for testing click\r\nhere.\r\nNext Steps\r\n\r\nIf our group were to continue the development of our app, there are a\r\ncouple of things we would like to see added. Fleshing out the amount of\r\ninformation displayed on the device’s screen would likely be one thing\r\nwe do. If our marketing of the app is based around how it has all the\r\ninformation a student needs, our prototype should reflect that, instead\r\nof just having placeholders for where information would go.\r\nAnother feature we would like to see is adding more distinct filters.\r\nBeing able to switch between academic events, school-affiliated\r\nextracurricular, and sporting events, for instance, would allow the user\r\nto clearly find what they are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nReflection\r\nBeing from a humanities background, with minimal coding and\r\nstatistical experience, I was a bit frightened by the almighty “R”. However, when learning what R\r\nwas and how it is used by many to illustrate narratives through\r\nstatistics, I was immediately hooked to the stories that can be used to\r\ntalk about what I interact with through numbers. With the helpful\r\npatience, wisdom and guidance of my professor: Rohan Alexander, I was\r\nable to warm up to the idea of coding, more specifically R, and I am\r\nforever grateful. Rohan’s class was called: INF312: Telling Stories\r\nWith Data. Being an avid reader with a passion for stories, I had\r\ndecided to leave behind my fears and worries with coding and get my\r\nelbows dirty by wrangling R and using R as my medium to generate stories\r\nabout the world through data. But this course also taught me valuable\r\nlessons and gave me some interesting insights into what is in store for\r\nmy future, as I now have a new skill in my so-called toolkit to unpack\r\nand apply to the world around me in my future endeavors. From being a\r\nbit afraid of R to now creating my digital portfolio using R, precisely\r\nthe distill packages\r\nshow the kind of growth I had as a student. But it is not just R I got\r\nto play around with. I also learned about Github and how amazing it is as a\r\nresource and repository for work.\r\nSamples with R\r\nOver the winter semester, I had found a silver lining between\r\nnarratives of my work produced with my introduction to R. This\r\nconnection was entirely by chance. Still, it speaks volumes about what I\r\nam most curious about, Family Dynamics.\r\nThe progression first report started out with Marriage. I tried to\r\nget a glimpse of the number of Marriage Licenses given out in Toronto at\r\na particular month, trying to see if there could be a conclusion to be\r\nmade; the short answer is yes, but to really see, check out the Tieing The Knot\r\nIn TO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoving onto the second report, I was able to work with Benner Feng\r\nand Elizabeth Yao Tong The three of us looked at the Canadian GSS Family\r\nCycle 31 Of 2017. Through the numerous categories and the sheer about of\r\ndata provided by CHASS (Computing in the Humanities and Social\r\nSciences), Data Center has partnered with many institutions to allow\r\nstudents from many disciplines to access data and interpret our world\r\nthrough data. The basis for the report was trying to capture any trends\r\nwithin the Canadian Family and try to write a narrative on our findings\r\nthrough the data gathered. To see our total findings and narrative,\r\ncheck out Capturing\r\nthe Happy Family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final report for the class I had wrote about Polygamy in Senegal\r\nduring the 1980s. The idea for this report was to link the story, So\r\nLong a Letter by Mariama Ba, more specifically about the main\r\ncharacter’s attitudes towards polygamy with the data from the\r\nSenegal DHS 1986 to give some context to why the author of the\r\nbook was writing about polygamy the way she does, check out So Long\r\nPolygamy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Hopes\r\nWith my new found appreciation for R, I am confident my curiosity and\r\nsheer enthusiasm for stories will be forever impacted. Now I can use\r\ndata to touch on topics I was initially scared to look into, like\r\nstatistics, math and finance. But I also see there is a whole new side\r\nof using R with the ideas I am a bit more familiar with and see if I can\r\nuse the data collected and gathered as a way to speak to a broader\r\naudience or to a reader who has different interests and background\r\nknowledge than me but still gather the messages I try to put out with my\r\nfuture works. Either way, I think this class really changed how I view\r\ninformation, data, and knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
