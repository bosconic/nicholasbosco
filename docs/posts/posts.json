    "contents": "\nThe popularization of science and technology is a fascinating topic.\nI learned about this topic in INF302: Integrative Approaches to\nScience & Technology. The definition of popularization is the\nidea of sharing and describing a complex idea among people who are not\nin the same field as you or do not have the same educational background\nas you puts the importance of communication into perspective. In one of\nthe assignments I had to complete for this class, I had decided to\ncritically analyze the chapters On the Public Understanding of\nScience and Expertise and Public Participation in Sergio Sismondo’s\nbook: An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies. The\nanalysis involved me taking these two chapters, synthesizing them, and\ndeveloping future steps of how we can begin to look at the\npopularization of science and technology. The popularization of science\nand technology resonates for me because communication and creating a\ndialogue around the objects/systems we interact with involves multiple\npoints of view and understandings to genuinely grasp what we see and\nuse. Thanks to this class, I can see the intersection of science and\ntechnology meet people. As it is the people who rely on this information\nand these technologies to navigate the real world.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nHaving no experience in Computer Science and Computational Thinking,\nI thought I was out of my element in the class INF313: Intro to\nComputational Thinking. However, being at the halfway point in the\ncourse, I have realized that computational thinking has more facets to\nlife in general, that does not strictly mean it is bound within a\ncomputer. I was able to see and use the ideas learned in the class, like\nstep wise refinement, taking a highly complex problem (abstraction) and\ntrying to see if I can break it down (decompose it) into more minor,\nmore manageable problems. As I continue my journey in this course, I\nbegin to have a greater appreciation of the many intricate parts that go\ninto a computer itself that I would not have given a thought to. For\nexample, computers rely on boolean algebra to take specific inputs and\nproduce outputs that the user understands. But navigating around these\n1’s and 0’s is a lot like the same functions we do today with language\nwhen describing when we use “and,” “or” and “not” in our language. Those\nwords can dictate an outcome of a particular situation.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nBeing fascinated by stories, one of the more difficult things is\ncapturing my narrative. It is one thing to describe someone else,\nwhether fictional or real life. However, it is easy to pick up on things\nand relate them to the experiences you have faced and somehow connect\nthem to the real world. For example, in the course INF401: Practicum\nPrep. The goal for the personal narrative assignment is to give me\nthe best tools I have at my disposal to present myself in front of a\npotential employer to fulfill my required minimum of 100 hours summer\nplacement. Having the opportunity to dig deep within myself to capture\nmy story was a cathartic experience because depending on how I described\nmyself, through the experiences I have made, I can begin to see the\ncapabilities I have. When writing the assignment, I could not help but\nthink of being in the real world engaging with many people, and things\nare almost like one whole big performance. Sometimes I may present\nmyself as an undergraduate with untapped potential when going into a\nfield I do not have much experience in but am willing to learn. Other\ntimes I may be a bit more knowledgeable with what I am being required to\ndo, so I have to play the role of the leader, trying to help guide peers\nwith a point of confusion they may face with a specific assignment. The\npoint here is that one has to be aware of the different appearances when\nout in the real world as it can be beneficial to getting that job you\nwant.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThe DI Design group consisted of Marco C., Chyna H. Zoie S., Yahui Z.\nand Elizabeth T. We had the prompt of building a collaborative computer\nin the class INF351: How to Build a Computer and Why?. A\ncollaborative computer is defined as a computer that involves more than\none user at a time. We noticed that sometimes kids are just told what\nthey should know, and on tests, they have to recite what they remember.\nHowever, this way of learning is inefficient in the classroom because\nthis does not prepare the child for the real world, by just memorizing\nfacts will not prepare the student for what is to come. The DI design\ngroup had created a computer (the image above) using an Arduino and the\nLCD to remedy this. We can now make learning more engaging and impactful\nfor the student. So they can learn from their peers and other stimuli\nlike the display to get feedback and improve their learning. This\nintroduction of a computerized flash-card quiz game tries to incorporate\nthe computer into education and point to a new way learning can be\nincorporated into a classroom with the help of a computer. This prompt\ntaught me how computers could have multiple applications and be used as\nan object of enjoyment instead of completing a specific task.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nFor my final project in INF311: Information in the Cultural\nImagination, I took it upon myself to create an Information Culture\nPlaylist that included 3-4 pieces of media ranging from movies to\nstories to ads and anything in between. I choose to talk about a\nplaylist that revolves around three short stories of Jorge Luis Borges.\nThese short stories are in his translated anthology of selected short\nstories: The Labyrinths to describe computing as a technology\nand a practice. By critically analyzing his three works: “Pierre Menard:\nAuthor of the Quixote”, “Funes the Memorious,” and “The Library\nof Babel,” I try to propose what Borges would say to the idea of “The\nComputer.” In “Pierre Menard: Author of the Quixote”, Borges\ntries to draw out the way we interpret words and if they change meanings\nif someone/thing else had said them. In “Funes the Memorious,” Borges\nwrites about a man who remembers every little detail but cannot see the\nbigger picture. Finally, we get to “The Library of Babel,” a place where\nit is possible to have access to the world’s information. As I rely on\nBorges’ words, the connection would not have been possible if it were\nnot for my exposure to this class and the BI program as a whole.\nRegarding Borges and his writing, his stories try to tackle heavy themes\nlike memory, information and imagination, all of which are themes that\nstudents like myself try to navigate. The big question to come out of\nthis paper I hope to dive into as I continue my journey in the BI\nprogram is whether there are more connections between computing and\nliterature. More specifically, as our understanding of technologies\nchange, does it affect how we interpret other aspects of our lives?\n\n\n\n",
